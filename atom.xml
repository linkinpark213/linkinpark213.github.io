    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s been a problem bothering me for more than a month.(I&#39;m not saying that this is the reason for not updating my blog, but you can think so!) When blogging with Hexo, every time I type a single quotation mark(also called apostrophe) like this:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&apos;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>, Hexo would convert it to a symbol like this<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">â€™</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>You would say that this is also an apotrophe, but it REALLY LOOKS STRANGE in the articles.</p><p><img src="images/apostrophe.png" alt="apostrophe"></p><p>Therefore, I Googled about this problem and tried to find other victims. According to their sharings, this problem is caused by <em>marked</em> -- the default markdown renderer of Hexo.The <em>&quot;smatrypants&quot;</em> function of marked was turned on by default.</p><p>Now take a look at the introduction of <em>smartypants</em> on the <em>hexo-renderer-marked</em> page:</p><blockquote><p><em>smartypants</em> - Use &quot;smart&quot; typograhic punctuation for things like quotes and dashes.</p></blockquote><p>C&#39;mon, seriously? </p><p>There are a few bloggers who solved this by adding the code below to the _config.yml file in the blog directory. </p><figure class="highlight yml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">mark:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">  smartypants:</span> <span class="literal">false</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This worked for most victims (perhaps all of them), but not for me. I have no idea why those config wasn&#39;t working, so if anyone finds out the reason, please contact me by e-mail.</p><p>If you&#39;re sure <em>smartypants</em> is causing the problem, and the solution above didn&#39;t work for you either, maybe you can try my solution.</p><p>Since <em>hexo-renderer-marked</em> is installed in the blog&#39;s <em>node_modules</em> directory(may also be in your Node.js directory if installed globally), isn&#39;t it possible that we change its own configurations? I looked at the <em>index.js</em> file in the <em>node_modules/hexo-renderer-marked/</em> directory. There you are, smartypants!</p><figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">hexo.config.marked = assign(&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  gfm: <span class="literal">true</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  pedantic: <span class="literal">false</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  sanitize: <span class="literal">false</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  tables: <span class="literal">true</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  breaks: <span class="literal">true</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  smartLists: <span class="literal">true</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  smartypants: <span class="literal">true</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  modifyAnchors: <span class="string">''</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  autolink: <span class="literal">true</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;, hexo.config.marked);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now you know what to do.</p>]]></content>

This anniversary is officially written as &#39;linkinpark213 Day&#39;, the first letter of which is a lower-case. The establishment of the anniversary dates back to the early 10s in the 21st century.</p><p>Till now, the population for this anniversary has already reached 1e-6 million, and the distribution also expanded from a small county to the whole middle-China area, including Hebei, Henan, Shanxi and Shaanxi province. There will also be some people living in Japan who plan to celebrate this day in 2019.</p><h2 id="Why-13th-Feb"><a href="#Why-13th-Feb" class="headerlink" title="Why 13th Feb?"></a>Why 13th Feb?</h2><p>According to the modern Chinese habit of writing, &#39;13th Feb&#39; is usually written as &#39;2.13&#39;. Also, &#39;13&#39; and &#39;B&#39; look similar and are often regarded to be equal. In conclusion, &#39;13 Feb&#39; can be transformed to &#39;2B&#39;, which is a common word in Chinese. Although the word is sometimes classified as &quot;offensive&quot;, it reflects feelings of optimism, bravery and entertainment.</p><h2 id="How-do-people-celebrate-the-day"><a href="#How-do-people-celebrate-the-day" class="headerlink" title="How do people celebrate the day?"></a>How do people celebrate the day?</h2><p>When the anniversary was first set up, there was no officially specified ways of celebration. People gathered, held parties and enjoyed spending time together. </p><p>On the 3th linkinpark213 Day, a proposal by a high school Chinese teacher was taken as the official way of celebration -- on each linkinpark213 Day, a number of people participate in the Pigeon-Flying Competition funded by Harper Long. This way of celebration prevailed until now, and all participants except Harper Long won the competition every year.</p><p>Pigeon-Flying is a broadly-accepted traditional Chinese custom, the exact origin of which is too ancient to be revealed. Modern scholars tend to believe that this custom became well-known no later than 206 A.D. in China. In modern times, pigeon-flying is an activity involving &quot;making a promise&quot; and &quot;not keeping it&quot;. According to some folk stories, this activity was firstly named when it happened to a pigeon keeper when he forgot to keep a promise that he made with a friend. </p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">main</span><span class="params">(String[] args)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    Promise promise = <span class="keyword">new</span> Promise();</span><br><span class="line">    promise.make(<span class="string">"I will come!"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    System.exit(<span class="number">0</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    promise.keep();</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>(Please notice that pigeon-flying mentioned here is not the same activity as what happens every Olympics since 1896 A.D.)</p><p>Join our celebration today!
