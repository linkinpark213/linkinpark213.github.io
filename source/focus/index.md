## About

This is my project for the Grand-prix competition in the Ubiquitous Computing Systems Laboratory of NAIST, and will be finished by August 7th.

The overall idea is to set focusing time periods according to your Google Calendar, and prevent you from getting distracted by your phone. While you're focusing, your notifications would be muted temporally and your irrelevant activities will be warned.

The application is designed only for Android 8.0 or higher, and works with Google Calendar.

Put down your phone and try to __Focus__ now!
